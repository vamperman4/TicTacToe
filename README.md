# Kenzie Academy Challenge: Tic-Tac-Toe

Follow the instructions provided on my.kenzie.academy for this challenge. The `code.js` file is a placeholder. Feel free to rename it add additional files to the project.

Customize this README.md however you want to turn it into documentation for your project (including deleting these opening paragraphs). The only required sections are the **Project Plan** and **Reflection** below. Be sure to use proper Markdown syntax in this file (here's a [cheatsheet PDF](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) of the basic syntax).

## Project Plan

_(Put your project plan here. It could be pseudocode, an outline-style development plan, etc. But whatever form you choose, it should be detailed enough that another developer could feasibly use it to implement your solution.)_
